# Deep dive into metagenomics using MMseqs2
As part of Dr. Martin Steinegger's presentation during the BVCN Conference in 2021 - "Metagenomic pathogen detection using MMseqs2, Plass, and Linclust" - Dr. Steinegger created a Python notebook that could be used as a companion tutorial for the presentation.

The presentation is hosted on our [YouTube page](https://youtu.be/nru9OnlG2zM)

The companion tutorial can be launched using the button below. Once loaded, double-click the file `BVCN.ipynb` to get started.

**Note #1:** Launching Binder can take 10+ minutes.

**Note #2:** This Binder launches with both mmseqs2 and plass installed, so that step will be skipped. All other steps (database downloads, etc.) will happen as part of the tutorial and may take additional time (as compared to the presentation) due to the data limitations within Binder.
